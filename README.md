**Red Team Operator & Penetration Tester**

I'm passionate about building and refining offensive security capabilities, with over 11 years of hands-on experience. With a background in development and DevOps, Iâ€™ve developed custom exploitation tools, created stealthy projects for real-world red team engagements, and currently focus on security research in adversarial AI projects.

I specialize in:
- Web, cloud, and mobile application penetration testing
- Red team tooling & C2 framework customization
- Evasion techniques across the entire red team kill chain
- Cloud (in)security assessments for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Security research & advanced adversary simulation
