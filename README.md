# üëã Howdy! Welcome to my GitHub!

**Hi! I'm Maor - Security Researcher & Offensive Security Enthusiast**

I'm passionate about building and refining my offensive security capabilities, backed by over 11 years of hands-on experience. With a strong background in development and DevOps, I've engineered custom exploitation tools and crafted stealthy projects for real-world red team engagements and sometimes just to make the job more fun and earn some solid l33t.

My interests:
- Security research in adversarial AI projects
- Web, cloud, and mobile application penetration testing
- Red team tooling & C2 framework customization
- Evasion techniques across the entire red team kill chain
- Cloud (in)security assessments for AWS, Azure, and GCP

‚ù§Ô∏è Hopefully you will enjoy and benefit from my projects - feel free to [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maor-tal-06a7ba2a/) to discuss them or exchange new ideas! 

See you inside!
