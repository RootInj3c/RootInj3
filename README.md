# 👋 Howdy! Welcome to my GitHub!

**Hi! I'm Maor - Security Researcher & Offensive Security Enthusiast**

I'm passionate about building and refining offensive security capabilities, with over 11 years of hands-on experience. With a background in development and DevOps, I’ve developed custom exploitation tools, created stealthy projects for real-world red team engagements, and currently focus on security research in adversarial AI projects.

I specialize in:
- Web, cloud, and mobile application penetration testing
- Red team tooling & C2 framework customization
- Evasion techniques across the entire red team kill chain
- Cloud (in)security assessments for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Security research & advanced adversary simulation

❤️ Hopefully you will enjoy and benefit from my projects — feel free to reach out @[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maor-tal-06a7ba2a/) to discuss them or exchange new ideas! 

See you inside!
